Iâ€™m Fotios Tragopoulos, a result-oriented Software and Cloud Engineer and programming guide author. I have worked as an Industrial Programmer, Frontend, Backend, Mobile, Cloud, Integration and DevOps engineer to innovate and implement new ideas in both start-ups and well-branded companies. I have managed projects in both R&D and production. Being in the founding scheme of companies in the past has allowed me to refine excellent leadership skills and to understand what challenges businesses face.

I am an advocate of agile methodologies who also loves coding, designing solution architectures, automating activities, building great products and helping businesses to succeed. I enjoy teaching, specifically design patterns and best practices. I am a strong believer of the power of positive thinking and enjoy discussing the latest technologies and trends.
